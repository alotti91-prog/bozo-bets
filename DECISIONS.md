Why Bozo Bets is built the way it is. Newest at the bottom. Add an entry whenever you make a choice someone (or Claude) might later wonder about.

**2026-10-20 · Standalone web app instead of a Claude artifact**
The first version was a Claude artifact. Every friend needed a Claude account and edit access to enter a pick, which was too much friction for a $10 bet. A plain website with email sign-in removes that.

**2026-10-20 · Stack: Vite + React, Supabase, Vercel**
It's the same stack as Red Haus, so the setup is already familiar. Free tiers cover six people easily. Supabase supplies the database, login, and live updates in one place.

**2026-10-20 · Website added to the home screen, not an App Store app**
A home-screen web app looks and feels like an app for this use. A store app would add review cycles, developer fees, and two codebases for no real gain.

**2026-10-20 · Email sign-in with a link *and* a typed code**
No passwords. On iPhone, a home-screen app keeps a separate login from Safari, so a link alone signs people in to the wrong place. The Magic Link email template must include `{{ .Token }}` so people can type the code instead. See the README, step 3.

**2026-10-20 · Players are separate from logins**
A player is a name in the bet. A login (member) can claim one player. Friends who never sign in still play, and the commish enters their legs. History stays attached to the player even if a login is removed.

**2026-10-20 · Permissions live in the database**
Row-level security plus a trigger on `legs` enforce the rules: members edit only their own ungraded leg in the current week, and only the commish grades. The app's buttons mirror the rules but don't enforce them. `npm run test:sql` checks this.

**2026-10-20 · The server picks the wheel result**
`spin_wheel()` picks the name with `gen_random_uuid()` bytes, which come from a cryptographically secure source. It logs the spin and sets next week's payer. Phones only animate to the answer, so a spinner can't rig the result by editing the app.

**2026-10-20 · Re-spins are allowed, but always logged**
Mistakes happen, such as a wrong name in the wheel. Only last week can be re-spun, and every spin shows in the Wheel log with a "re-spin" tag.

**2026-10-20 · Spins play live on every phone**
A new row in `spins` arrives over Supabase Realtime, and every phone with the Wheel tab open animates the same spin. It's the most fun part of the app, and it cost about 20 lines.

**2026-10-20 · Reload the whole league on any change**
A season is a few hundred rows. Re-fetching everything on any live event is simpler and harder to get wrong than patching local state. Revisit this if a league ever gets big.

**2026-10-20 · Money counts settled weeks only**
"Put in," "Paid," and "Net" only count weeks that hit or busted. A live week isn't money lost yet. Net per person = their share of payouts minus what they put in as payer.

**2026-10-21 · Read the Vercel Supabase integration's keys**
The Vercel Supabase integration names its variables `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY`, but Vite only exposes `VITE_` ones. `vite.config.js` passes through exactly those two public values (falling back to the `VITE_` names, and to `anon` keys on older projects). It deliberately does not use `envPrefix: 'SUPABASE_'`, because that would ship the service-role key and JWT secret to every browser.

**2026-10-20 · Demo mode**
`npm run demo` swaps in an in-memory fake of Supabase with sample data, so anyone can work on screens without setting up a backend. `vite.config.js` swaps it out of real builds.

**2026-10-21 · Imported 2026 Weeks 1-3 from the old Google Sheet**
`supabase/imports/2026-weeks-1-3.sql` adds the sheet's three filled-in weeks as Weeks 1-3 and renumbers the open week to 7, so app week numbers match NFL weeks like the sheet's did. It stops before changing anything if a sheet name isn't in the league, to avoid duplicate players. The gray "Puka 70+" was a void, so it's stored as a push with placeholder odds (−110), and pushes are now left out of average odds. Payers and wheel spins weren't in the sheet, so those weeks have none. `npm run test:import` checks it.

**2026-10-21 · "Solo $100" standings column**
The sheet tracked each person's running profit as if they'd bet $100 on their own leg alone. Standings now shows the same number (win: the payout on $100, loss: −$100, push: $0), and a test checks it against the sheet's totals.
